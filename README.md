# Markov State Modelling Workshop May 2019


### Aimed at: 
Anyone interested in learning how to use Markov state models to analyse molecular simulations.


### Requirements:  

- Basic Python knowledge
- Basic Linear algebra
- Basic knowledge of setting up and running molecular simulations 


### Abstract: 
Markov State Models (MSM) are a set of tools to analyse molecular simulation trajectories in order to obtain estimates of long-timescale dynamics and free energies for the system of study. MSMs have been used in the past to study short term dynamics such as side chain rearrangements, to much longer dynamical properties such as protein folding, allostery, or protein-protein association. This workshop will give an introduction to the theory behind MSMs followed by a hands-on session on building an MSM. Essential steps such as clustering the simulation data, estimation of the MSM and validation of the MSM as well as the MSMs physical interpretations will be covered. We will be using pyEMMA as the software framework throughout the workshop.
